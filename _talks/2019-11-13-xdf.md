Myrtle.ai will describe how their RNN accelerator on an Alveo U250 outperforms
alternatives in throughput, power and latency. They will describe how this has
been achieved by exploiting unstructured sparsity and quantisation implemented
on a scalable array of highly optimised MAU Acceleratorâ„¢ cores. The results of
a comparison using a DeepSpeech benchmark will demonstrate this FPGA advantage
in a range of applications including speech to text transcription and time
series analysis.
