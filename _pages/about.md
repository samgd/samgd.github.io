I have significant experience using and compressing convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and Transformers for time
series and sequential tasks. I have a strong understanding of compression
techniques such as quantization and sparsity and specific domains such as
speech recognition, speech synthesis, and natural language processing.

More broadly I'm interested in utilising machine learning and reinforcement
learning to solve problems.

Please get in touch if our interests overlap ðŸ˜Š.
