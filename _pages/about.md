I'm the technical lead of machine learning at
<a href="https://myrtle.ai">Myrtle.ai</a>, a company that specializes in
the efficient deployment of deep neural networks at scale. I lead the machine
learning team in building products and solutions, engage with customers to
understand their requirements, and keep track of the latest research to include
within our products and solutions.

I have significant experience using and compressing convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and Transformers for time
series and sequential tasks due to Myrtle.ai's focus in this area. I have a
strong understanding of compression techniques such as quantization and
sparsity and specific domains such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, and
natural language processing.

More broadly I'm interested in utilising machine learning and reinforcement
learning to solve problems.

Please get in touch if our interests overlap ðŸ˜Š.
