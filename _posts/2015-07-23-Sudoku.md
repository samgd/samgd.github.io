title: Sudoku Solving
highlight: true

Sudoku is an nxn grid based puzzle, typically 9x9, in which the aim is to fill
each of the cells with an element from the set (1..n) such that the rows,
columns and, in the examples beneath 3x3, sub-grids contain all elements from
(1..n).  Some of the cells of a puzzle are filled in, these are known as the
givens.

There are many different algorithms with varying complexities that can be used
to solve a Sudoku but brute force, backtracking, and Dancing Links are
discussed, implemented in Ruby, and benchmarked below.

Example Sudoku:

### Sudoku Model

The aim, using the [strategy
pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern), is to produce a
family of algorithms that can be interchangeably used to solve a Sudoku.  Each
algorithm will model a Sudoku puzzle as a single string made from the
concatenation of its rows with '.' representing the unknown cells.  Thus the
example above becomes:

```ruby
".3..........195....98....6.8...6....4....3..1....2.....6....28....419..5.......7."
```

and the unique valid solution:

```ruby
"534678912672195348198342567859761423426853791713924856961537284287419635345286179"
```

This data structure is encompassed by the Sudoku class.  The class provides
methods that return arrays of the Sudoku's rows, columns, and sub-grids
respectively.  These are calculated from the internal string representation
upon method call and the results are cached to reduce the access time of future
requests.  It also overrides 'to_s' for pretty printing and provides getter and
setter methods, '[]' and '[]=', for accessing and modifying the internal
string, ensuring to invalidate any cached values upon change.

The last method is 'solve' that, using [dynamic
dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch), will use the given
algorithm to return a valid solution (provided one exists).

```ruby
$codeSnippet("code/sudoku/sudoku.rb")$
```

The first two algorithms, brute force and backtracking, will require a way
to check if a possible candidate solution is valid.  This can be achieved by
implementing methods to test if a candidate meets the three conditions stated
above.  To keep the code as DRY as possible these will be wrapped in a Solution
module and used as a mixin where necessary.

```
$codeSnippet("code/sudoku/solution.rb")$
```

### Brute force

A brute force or exhaustive search algorithm aims to find a solution by
enumerating through all possible candidates until one passes.  There are
6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 distinct Sudoku puzzles thus this method is _not_
quick however it does guarantee that a solution will be found provided
the puzzle is correct!

The 'solve' method iterates through each candidate and returns it if it's a
solution.  Checking is made easy by including the Solution mixin shown above.
Generating candidates is done in a naive way by enumerating through all
possible 81 digit numbers from "111...1" to "999...9", skipping those that
include a 0 or contain values that don't match the puzzle's givens.

```{.pre-scrollable}
$codeSnippet("code/sudoku/brute_force.rb")$
```

### Backtracking

The backtracking algorithm effectively walks left to right along the string
representation of a puzzle replacing unknown cells with a value, ensuring to
preserve the invariant that each number in the set (1..9) must be unique in
each row, column and sub-grid, and returning the solution if found.

The algorithm backtracks if an unknown value cannot be filled or the end of the
string is reached without a solution being found.  It does so by walking back
to the last unknown cell and replacing it with an unused but still correct
value.  If there are no possible values then the cell is reset to "." and the
backtracking process repeats.

A logged output of the algorithm solving a Sudoku can be found
[here](/files/code/backtracking_example.txt).

This can also be thought of as a depth-first traversal of a tree of
candidate solutions with the tree's branches and nodes only being created when
required thus reducing the typical space and computation requirements.

The walk, or tree traversal, is handled by the recursive method 'search'.  As
'search' modifies the given sudoku it must not be invoked directly.  Instead the
'solve' method first duplicates the given sudoku and then calls 'search',
this protects the user from any unexpected side effects.

### Dancing Links

> to the exact cover problem.
>
> The exact cover problem is represented in Algorithm X using a matrix A

> [More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X)

The idea of this algorithm is to reduce the problem of solving a Sudoku to that
of exact cover.  This is achieved by creating a sparse matrix of 0s and 1s that
represents a given puzzle, finding a subset of this matrix's rows such that
each column of the combined subset contains exactly one 1, and then
transforming these rows back into a solution.

The matrix has four blocks of columns, each 81 bits in length, that correspond
to the following constraints:

- Each row can only contain each number once.
- Each column can only contain each number once.
- Each sub-grid can only contain each number once.
- Each cell can only contain one number.

Each row in the matrix represents a certain configuration thus there are four
bits per row, one for each constraint.

A visual of the matrix showing all the candidate possibilities and constraints
can be found
[here](http://www.stolaf.edu/people/hansonr/sudoku/exactcovermatrix.htm).

The 'constraints' method is used to generate the rows, skipping over any that
are invalid due to the given values of the puzzle.  These rows are added to a
sparse matrix from my implementation of Knuth's dancing links
[here](https://github.com/samgd/dlx) and the first set of rows that it returns
is converted back into a Sudoku and returned as the solution.

```{.pre-scrollable}
$codeSnippet("code/sudoku/dancing_links.rb")$
```

[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth's_Algorithm_X) and the

### Benchmarks

Ideally the same method would be used to benchmark each algorithm however the
brute force algorithm is ridiculously slow so it is discussed separately first.

The brute force algorithm took 1714.2 seconds to cycle through 88888888
possible candidates, ~1e-71% of the total number.  At worst it would take
1.7142e+76 seconds, or ~5.43e+68 years, to iterate through all candidates.  The
best case, that the first candidate is a valid solution, takes effectively 0
time thus, on average, it _only_ takes 8.571e+75 years to find a solution!

The remaining two algorithms were benchmarked by recording the average time
taken to solve sets of 20000 puzzles, each with a decreasing number of givens.

The sets can be found
[here](https://github.com/samgd/samgd.github.io/tree/master/files/code/sudoku/tests).

![](/images/sudoku_results_plot.png "Sudoku Results Plot"){.img-responsive .center-block}

The plot above shows that the dancing links algorithm runs in linear time
whilst the backtracking algorithm runs in polynomial time.  It should be noted,
however, that some of the backtracking algorithm's large increase in average
solve time may be due to cache misses, I'll update this post after I've had time
to fully explore this.
